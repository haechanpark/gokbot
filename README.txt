Proposed Tool or tools

Discord.py https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ which allows the development of a robot on the discord platform that can interact and talk to users. 

Wikipedia API https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/ which allows for some basic web scraping capabilities

Asyncio Library https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html used to allow for asynchronous code to occur

Summary: Our project is essentially what we learned about artificial intelligence and machine learning about from last semester but taking it to the next step by creating a live interactable bot on a social media platform. Although it can be said that many of these bots were made, we made ours unique by adapting web scraping capabilities as well as unique features that no other developer has put in.
